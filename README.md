## About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Cam, a junior at UMass Lowell studying Computer Science, as well as a software engineering intern at the MWRA. Passionate about all things technology, cars, and fitness. I've been coding since high school, with my goal being to get better and improve every day. Whether it be school work or personal projects, I'm always coding. Although I have a majority of my programming experience in C & C++, I am currently learning about web development, both front and back end.
