## About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Cam, a Sophomore at UMass Lowell studying Computer Science. Passionate about all things technology, cars, and fitness. I've been coding since high school, with my goal being to get better and improve every day. Whether it be school work or personal projects, I'm always coding. Mainly C / C++, but have also been teaching myself Python in my free time.
